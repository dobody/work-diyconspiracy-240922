Poster files for a DIY Conspiracy event

Poster made with GIMP 2.10.32, processed through p5js, laid out in scribus.

### Depends on:
- GIMP 2.10.32 or later
- p5.js library
- Scribus 1.5.8 or later


### Steps:
1. Create black and white image in gimp with fonts or content you want
2. Make new p5js project and copy `sketch1.js` or `sketch2.js` to it. `sketch1.js` analyses the first pixel inside each new cell, ie top left, while `sketch2.js` makes an average of all pixels inside the cell
3. Save p5js image
4. Open in scribus and lay out image for CMYK color separation.
